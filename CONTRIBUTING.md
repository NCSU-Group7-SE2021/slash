## ü™≤ Reporting Bugs
This section serves as your guide for submitting a bug report for this repository. Adhering to these instructions helps both maintainers and the community understand your report, replicate the issue, and locate related reports. Before initiating a bug report, please perform a preliminary search to verify if the problem has already been reported. If you find an open issue matching your concern, add a comment to that existing issue rather than opening a new one. Note: If you encounter a closed issue that appears similar to your experience, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue within the body of your new report.

### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

GitHub issues are the designated method for tracking bugs. After determining the repository relevant to your bug, create an issue on that repository and complete the template by supplying the following details:

* Craft a concise and informative title for the issue to clearly identify the problem.
* Elaborate on the precise steps required to reproduce the problem, offering as many details as possible. Additionally, furnish 
  information about your operating system's name and version, Python version, and any environmental configurations you've applied.
* Present specific examples that illustrate the steps, which may encompass links to files or GitHub projects or easily copy-and- 
  pasteable code snippets if applicable. When providing code snippets in the issue, use Markdown code blocks.
* Detail the observed behavior following the steps and pinpoint the specific issue with that behavior.
* Clarify the anticipated behavior you expected to see instead and elucidate the reasons behind your expectations.
* If the problem pertains to performance or memory issues, include particulars about the encountered errors in your report.
* Provide insights into your ability to consistently replicate the issue. If replication isn't guaranteed, share information about the 
  frequency and typical conditions under which the problem usually occurs.

### Before Submitting A Bug Report

Prior to initiating a bug report, please consult existing bug reports to prevent unnecessary duplication. It's conceivable that solutions have already been posted for similar issues. If not, you're encouraged to submit a bug report, and we'll investigate it as promptly as possible.

## üìù Suggesting Enhancements and New features

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for this project:

### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. Create an issue on that repository with an enhancement or feature tag and provide the following information:
* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to clearly outline your suggestion.
* Furnish a detailed, step-by-step description of the proposed enhancement, offering as much information as possible.
* Provide concrete examples to illustrate the steps, incorporating easily copy-and-pasteable code snippets formatted as Markdown code     
  blocks.
* Explain the existing behavior and specify the behavior you anticipated instead, along with the reasons for your expectations.
* Our repository relies on robust documentation. Feel free to contribute updates and enhancements to our documentation.
* If you have any exciting new features in mind, we'd love to hear about them and explore the possibilities.

## üôá Pull Requests
1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the [README.md](https://github.com/NCSU-Group7-SE2021/slash/blob/main/README.md) with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the [README.md](https://github.com/NCSU-Group7-SE2021/slash/blob/main/README.md) to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is SemVer.
4. After submitting your PR, the first thing you would want to do will be a self review. Barring special circumstances, maintainers will not review PRs until all checks pass (Travis, AppVeyor, etc).
5. One or more maintainers will use GitHub's review feature to review your PR.
6. If the maintainer asks for any changes, edit your changes, push, and ask for another review. Additional tags (such as needs-tests) will be added depending on the review.
7. If the maintainer decides to pass on your PR, they will thank you for the contribution and explain why they won't be accepting the changes. That's ok! We still really appreciate you taking the time to do it, and we don't take that lightly.
8. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## üëí Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages
*	Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
*	Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
*	Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
*	Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
*	When only changing documentation, include [ci skip] in the commit title

### Git Branching Naming Convention
Not using appropriate naming conventions leads to confusion and complicates the code maintenance team. We can‚Äôt ignore Git best practices in branching naming conventions.

- Main (main) is the default branch available in the Git repository. It should be stable all the time and won‚Äôt allow any direct check-in. You can only merge it after code review. All team members are responsible for keeping the master stable and up-to-date.

- <b>Make sure the new branch you create follows proper naming conventions.</b>
```<author>-<date in (DD-MMMM) format>-<short-feature-description>```
<br> E.g., rahil-6-sept-test-badge
E.g., moksh-7-sept-web-scraping

This method allows for easy tracking of different developers‚Äô work and progress with additional systems.
